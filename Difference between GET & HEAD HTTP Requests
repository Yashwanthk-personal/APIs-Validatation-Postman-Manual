Lets learn a very important difference in API : GET vs HEAD

*****************
ðŸ”´ GET Method
*****************

âœ… Usage:

The GET method is used to request data from the server. It is meant for retrieving resources identified by the given URL. GET requests should only retrieve data and should not have any other side effects on the server.

âœ… Example Scenario:

When you open a web page in your browser, the browser sends a GET request to the server to fetch the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets required to render the web page.

âœ… REST Assured Example:

given()
.when()
.get("/api/users/123")
.then()
.statusCode(200)
.body("key", equalTo("value"));

âœ… Response:

The server processes the request and returns the requested data in the response body along with metadata (such as headers and status codes).

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "id": 123,
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "status": "active"
}

******************
ðŸ”´ HEAD Method
******************

âœ… Usage:

The HEAD method is very similar to GET but is used when you only want to retrieve the headers of the response without the response body. It is useful when you need to check if a resource exists, retrieve metadata, or check the resource's modification date without actually downloading the content.

âœ… Example Scenario:

When you want to check if a specific file exists on a web server without downloading the entire file, you can use the HEAD method.

âœ… REST Assured Example:

given()
.when()
.head("/api/users/123")
.then()
.statusCode(200)
.header("Content-Type", "application/json");

âœ… Response

The server processes the request but only returns the headers (metadata) in the response, not the actual data.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 548
Last-Modified: Tue, 10 Aug 2023 15:30:00 GMT

In summary, GET is used for retrieving data along with the response body, while HEAD is used for retrieving metadata and headers without the response body.

IMP: Both methods are useful in different scenarios, and the choice between them depends on your specific requirements, such as whether you need the actual content or just metadata.
